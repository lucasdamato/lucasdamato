## Hi

🔭 I’m currently focused on learning how to build websites & web apps

🌱 Deep-diving into core structures: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git & VS Code

⚡️ I thrive on rapid, minimal-path learning—seeking the quickest routes to understanding new tools

🤝 New to coding and open to help: mentorship, code reviews or project ideas are hugely appreciated

💡 Workflow: break problems into bite-sized tasks, prototype fast & iterate often

📫 Feel free to open an issue, send a PR or share any resources you think might help!
